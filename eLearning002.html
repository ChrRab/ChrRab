<H2 class=section><A name=htoc2>2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic Models</H2>
<P><A name=sec:EconomicModels></A></P>
<P>During our course we will derive some conclusions or theorems which allow us 
to describe the real economy. But the immense complexity of the real economy 
makes it impossible for us to understand all the interrelationships. Therefore 
it is necessary to pick out the primary factors and relationships relevant to 
our problem. Hence we have to look at an abstraction from the real world.</P>
<P>Such an abstraction can be made with help of a <B>model</B>. A model is a 
simplified representation of the world. It is a formal method to analyse 
interactions and to draw conclusions. We will discuss some microeconomic models 
which will help us to understand why people are acting as they do in the real 
world. Of course, as all our models are just a simplification, our models will 
not allow to predict all interrelationships, but our models will be general 
enough to draw conclusions for understanding the real economy.</P>
<P>Furthermore it should be noted that a model should be applicalbe in general 
and not only in a special case and the model should allow us to draw conclusions 
which are observable in the real world.</P>
<H3 class=subsection><A name=toc1></A><A 
name=htoc3>2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingredients of a Model</H3>
<P><A name=sec:Ingredients></A></P>
<P>Usually models in microeconomic theory are mathematical models, i.e. we will 
usually have a set of (in-)<B>equations</B> which describe the structure of the 
model. Within these (in-)equations we will use <B>variables, constants and 
parameters</B>.</P>
<H5 class=paragraph>Variables</H5>
<P>All models need at least one <B>variable</B>. A variable is something that 
can take on different values. Very common variables in economic models include 
price, profit, revenue, cost, national income, consumption, investment, imports, 
exports, etc. As a variable can take on different values we will use symbols 
instead of numbers. For example <I>p</I> represents the price, <I>x</I> the 
quantity, <I>m</I> will be a personsâ€™ income, etc. As long as we use the symbols 
for the variables, they can take on any value. But by writing e.g. <I>p</I> = 3 
we can assign a fix value to the variable.</P>
<P>There can be two types of variables in a model, <B>endogenous</B> and 
<B>exogenous</B> variables. An endogenous variable is determined by forces 
described in the model and the modelled relationships have an impact on the 
variable. An exogenous variable is a variable which is taken as determined by 
factors not discussed in this particular model. But of course both types have an 
influence on the outcome of our model.</P>
<H5 class=paragraph>Constants</H5>
<P>A <B>constant</B> is a number in a model that does not change. It is a fixed 
number. Very often constants appear as coefficients of variables, e.g. 2<I>p</I> 
or 4<I>x</I>.</P>
<H5 class=paragraph>Parameters</H5>
<P>To make your model more general it might be helpful to make some constants 
variable. E.g. to gain a higher level of generality you make the coefficients of 
your variables also variable, e.g. <I>ap</I> or <I>bx</I> instead of 2<I>p</I> 
or 4<I>x</I>. In that case this means that you can also draw conclusions from 
your model if the constants change their values and this implies that you model 
is more general.</P>
<H5 class=paragraph>Equations and Identities</H5>
<P>Finally we need some equations or inequations which allow us to describe 
dependencies or interrelations between our variables. As an example let us 
assume that we have the variables price <I>p</I>, quantity <I>x</I> and revenue 
<I>R</I>. So we can identify the relationship </P>
<TABLE class="display dcenter">
  <TBODY>
  <TR vAlign=center>
    <TD class=dcell><I>R</I>(<I>p</I>,<I>x</I>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<I>p</I> 
    <I>x</I></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>This relationship tells us that the revenue <I>R</I> depends on the price 
<I>p</I> and the (sold) quantity <I>x</I> and is calculated by multiplying price 
<I>p</I> by the quantity <I>x</I>.</P>
<P>In this example we only used variables. Now let us look at an example where 
we also use a constant: Assume a firm has fix costs of 100. The firm faces this 
cost independent of the produced quantity. Furthermore for the production of one 
unit of output <I>x</I> the firm faces costs of 25 per unit. These costs are the 
variable costs. Then the total costs <I>C</I> can be modelled as </P>
<TABLE class="display dcenter">
  <TBODY>
  <TR vAlign=center>
    <TD 
      class=dcell><I>C</I>(<I>x</I>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&nbsp;<I>x</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;100</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Now we have one variable on the right hand side of our equation, namely 
<I>x</I> and two constants, namely 25 for the variable costs per unit and 100 
for the fix costs. If we now want to make our model more general, we could use 
parameters instead of the constants. Let us say that 
<I>C</I><SUB><I>fix</I></SUB> is the parameter for our fix costs. Then we would 
have </P>
<TABLE class="display dcenter">
  <TBODY>
  <TR vAlign=center>
    <TD 
      class=dcell><I>C</I>(<I>x</I>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&nbsp;<I>x</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<I>C</I><SUB><I>fix</I></SUB>&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>For further generalization we could also parameterize our variable unit costs 
<I>c</I><SUB><I>v</I></SUB> and get </P>
<TABLE class="display dcenter">
  <TBODY>
  <TR vAlign=center>
    <TD 
      class=dcell><I>C</I>(<I>x</I>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<I>c</I><SUB><I>v</I></SUB>&nbsp;<I>x</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<I>C</I><SUB><I>fix</I></SUB></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>While the cost function with the constants will represent the cost function 
of one specific firm, the generalized cost function could now represent the cost 
function of various firms.</P>
<P>An important hint: The <I>x</I> in the term <I>C</I>(<I>x</I>) tells us, that 
the equation only depends on <I>x</I>, i.e. <I>x</I> is our variable. So we know 
that <I>c</I><SUB><I>v</I></SUB> and <I>C</I><SUB><I>fix</I></SUB> have to be 
parameters.</P>

<B>Welcome to the E-Learning for your course in Micro
Economics.</B>
</DIV><P>In economics we want to derive a set of conclusions or theorems from a
given set of assumptions via a process of reasoning<SUP><A NAME="text1" HREF="eLearning006.html#note1">1</A></SUP>. For deriving such conclusions we need an
<I>approach</I> to economic analysis. Here we will use economic
models, in which the economist makes use of mathematical symbols in
the statement of the problem. These models will help us in reasoning
the conclusions (given our set of assumptions).</P><P>This E-Learning is intended to make you familiar with the mathematical
theorems which are needed to understand microeconomic theory. During
this E-Learning some mathematical theorems will be explained. But you
do not have to be afraid, all mathematical theorems discussed here,
should be already known from school, hence the E-Learning should just
help you to bring back memories and maybe to view the things you
learned in school in a different way. Furthermore all theorems will be
presented in a non mathematical way, so that also students without the
necessary background will understand the most important theorems.</P><P>At the end of this E-Learning you will have to answer some review
questions. These questions should help you to test your mathematical
skills. 
<!--<B>You will be asked to hand in your solutions in our first session!</B>-->
It is not necessary that all your solutions are correct. Wrong results indicate
that you should repeat the mathematical backround from school once
again (e.g. with help of this E-Learning). 
</P><P>After our first session the solutions will be provided here and you
will have the possiblity to check your results! If you have no
problems in answering the questions you should be able to understand
all the models which will be discussed during the course. If you have
still troubles in answering the questions after doing this E-Learning
you should ask your lecturer for further literature to repeat the
relevant mathematic theory.</P><P>Please note that the text represented in this E-Learning is based on
the textbook <B>Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics</B> by
Alpha C. Chiang and Kevin Wainwright, Fourth Edition, published by
McGraw-Hill/Irwin, ISBN 007-123823-9. The following sections of the
textbook will be covered by this E-Learning: 1.1, 2.1, 2.4-2.7,
6.1-6.3. As the (sub-)sections are named as in the textbook there will
be no further references during the E-Learning.</P><P>Furthermore please note that this E-Learning is only intended for
students of the branch tourism management who participate in the
courses in Micro- and Macroeconomics. <B>You are not allowed to
share or forward the presented contents!</B></P><HR>
